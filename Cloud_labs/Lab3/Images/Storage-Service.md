HUAWEI CLOUD Storage Services Practice

This project showcases three fundamental storage services offered by HUAWEI CLOUD:

. Elastic Volume Service (EVS)
. Object Storage Service (OBS)
. Scalable File Service (SFS)

The lab exercises are designed to provide hands-on experience in provisioning, managing, and utilizing these services to meet various business requirements.

üöÄ Elastic Volume Service (EVS) Practice
Elastic Volume Service (EVS) provides persistent block-level storage for Elastic Cloud Servers (ECSs). EVS disks behave like physical hard drives and are used to extend server storage.

üîπ Key Concepts
. EVS disks must be in the same Availability Zone (AZ) as the ECS to be attached.
. EVS disks support persistent data, independent of any specific ECS.

üõ†Ô∏è Windows ECS and EVS Workflow

1. Network Setup

. Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and a subnet.

2. Provision ECS and EVS
   . Launch a Windows ECS.
. Purchase a separate EVS data disk.

3. Attach and Initialize Disk
   . Wait for the EVS disk to be in an Available state.
. Attach the disk to the ECS.
. Use Disk Management to:
. Bring the disk online
. Choose partition style (MBR or GPT)
. Create and format a New Simple Volume

4. Verify Persistence

. Create a test file on the new volume (e.g., D:).
. Take the disk offline in Windows OS.
. Detach from ECS and attach to a second Windows ECS.
. Log in and bring the disk online.
. Confirm the test file is present.

üêß Linux ECS and EVS Workflow
1. Provision ECS and Attach EVS
. Launch a Linux ECS.
. Attach the EVS disk.

2. Disk Initialization via CLI
   . Use fdisk to create a partition on /dev/vdb.
. Format using mkfs.ext4.
. Create a mount point directory (e.g., /mnt/data).
. Use mount to attach the filesystem.
. Edit /etc/fstab for auto-mount at startup.

3. Using Snapshots 
. Create a snapshot of the Linux EVS disk.
. From the snapshot, create a new EVS disk.
. Attach it to another ECS to verify snapshot restoration and cloning.

‚òÅÔ∏è Object Storage Service (OBS) Practice
OBS provides storage for massive unstructured data (e.g., documents, images, videos) using an object storage model.

üîπ Bucket Operations
1. Create a Bucket
   . Define region, storage class (e.g., Standard), and access policy (e.g., Private).

  2. File Operations
    . Upload files from the local computer.
. Download objects to the local system.
. Delete files and folders in the bucket.

This section builds foundational skills in OBS console operations and data management.

üìÅ Scalable File Service (SFS) Practice
SFS provides high-performance, shared file storage, ideal for environments requiring simultaneous access by multiple servers.

üîπ SFS Turbo Setup

1. Create SFS Turbo
. Deploy the file system within the existing VPC.

2. Mount on Linux ECS

. Install nfs-utils.
. Use the mount command with the NFS protocol.
. Create a shared directory and a test file.

3. Mount on Windows ECS
. Install Client for NFS via Server Manager.
. Reboot the system.
. Use mount in Command Prompt to map the SFS to a drive letter.
. Confirm that the test file created in Linux ECS is accessible.

‚úÖ Conclusion
This hands-on project highlights how to:

. Provision and manage block storage (EVS) with snapshot capabilities
. Handle object-based storage (OBS) with bucket-based management
. Utilize shared file systems (SFS) for cross-platform access

These exercises equip users with practical knowledge to effectively use Huawei Cloud storage services in real-world scenarios.
